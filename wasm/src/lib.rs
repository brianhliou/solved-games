//! WASM bindings that put the *validated* Rust engine in the browser, so the
//! explorer never re-implements morris rules in JS (a re-implementation could
//! silently disagree with the solve). The browser gets legal-move generation and
//! perfect-play probing straight from the engine; the tablebase is loaded as raw
//! bytes and probed via the engine's own dense index.
//!
//! Wire format keeps the JS boundary dumb: positions are `[white, black, w_hand,
//! b_hand, turn]`, move lists are flat `u32` groups of 6 (`position…, value`),
//! and values are `0=win 1=loss 2=draw 3=unknown` from the relevant side.
