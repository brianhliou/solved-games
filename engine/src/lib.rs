//! A generic retrograde-analysis engine for strongly solving small, finite,
//! perfect-information, two-player games.
//!
//! The engine knows no rules. It operates entirely through the [`Game`] trait:
//! a game supplies a way to enumerate, index, and step its positions, and the
//! engine supplies the strong solve (a game-theoretic value for *every* reachable
//! position) via backward induction that handles cycles (draws by repetition).
//!
//! This is the same shape as GAMESMAN / OpenSpiel / Ludii: one solver, many games.
