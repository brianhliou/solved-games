//! Three men's morris (Tapatan ruleset: 3x3 grid, diagonals are both mill lines
//! and move connections). Each player has three men. Phase 1: alternately place
//! all three. Phase 2: slide a man to an adjacent point. A player wins by forming
//! a mill (all three men on a line) or by leaving the opponent with no legal move.
//! With only three men and a movement phase, positions can repeat — so this is the
//! engine's first genuinely *cyclic* game, where unresolved positions are draws.
//!
//! The mill lines and adjacency are the eight tic-tac-toe lines; adjacency is the
//! king-move graph they induce (centre connects to all eight).
